                <h2>HIS STORY</h2>
                <p>
                    As a child growing up in Lagos, Nigeria, I was surrounded by the vibrant sights, sounds, and flavors of Nigerian cuisine. <br> 
                    <br> My family's kitchen was always filled with the aromas of jollof rice, suya, and pounded yam, and our dining table was a place of gathering, laughter, and love. <br> 
                    
                    <br> However, as much as I cherished the flavors of my Nigerian heritage, I was also deeply influenced by my Haitian roots. <br>

<br> My parents, originally from Haiti, instilled in me a deep appreciation for Haitian culture and cuisine. <br>
<br> I grew up hearing stories of my family's homeland, tasting traditional Haitian dishes like griot, diri djon djon, and pikliz, and learning about the importance of food as a symbol of community and connection. <br>
<br> As I journeyed through life, these two culinary worlds collided within me, sparking an idea that would eventually become <i> Lagos Creole </i> . <br>

                <h2>OUR VISION </h2>
                <p>
                    <br> I envisioned a restaurant where the bold, spicy flavors of Nigerian cuisine would blend seamlessly with the comforting, soulful dishes of Haiti. It was a reflection of my own identity – a fusion of two cultures, two worlds, two parts of myself.

Opening Lagos Creole was more than just a business venture; it was a deeply personal mission to celebrate the richness and diversity of my heritage. <br>
<br> I wanted to create a space where people from all walks of life could come together to experience the flavors of Nigeria and Haiti, to celebrate the beauty of cultural exchange, and to forge connections over shared meals. <br>

<br> Through Lagos Creole, I hope to honor the traditions of both Nigeria and Haiti while also pushing the boundaries of culinary creativity. 
It's my way of paying homage to my roots, sharing my passion for food with others, and spreading a little bit of joy and flavor to the world. <br>
